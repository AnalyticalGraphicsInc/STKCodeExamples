## [ConstrainedAttitude](ConstrainedAttitude)

This plugin allows you to implement angle limit constraints on your vehicle's attitude. Select a vector to align a body axis with, then constrain another body axis to a specified constraint vector. Finally, specify an angle offset limit from the constraint vector.

![UserInterface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60355211/130655866-5df9e4e6-920a-4ea0-a1e1-2159a04f102a.png)

After creating the attitude, the vehicle will remain aligned with the alignment vector until reaching the angle offset limit. Once at the limit, the attitude will hold there while still attempting to stay with the alignment vector. Once the angle offset is below the limit, the attitude returns to normal.

## [GroundVehicleFromDirections](GroundVehicleFromDirections)

This plugin utilized the Bing Maps API to create an STK ground vehicle.  The plugin allows for 3 different options to generate these ground vehciles.

1) Enter an origin and destination address and it will route a GroundVehicle along this path
2) Enter an origin and destination address and it will route a GroundVehicle along this path
3) Select a lat/lon box and the number of GroundVehicles and it will generate paths from random start/stop locations within the box to simulate traffic
