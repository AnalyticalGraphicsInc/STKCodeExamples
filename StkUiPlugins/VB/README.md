## [AstroDynUi](AstroDynUi)

This plugin allows users to visualize various astrodynamical parameters of a satellite's orbit.

First, define the orbital paramters; then, choose the propagator to use; finally, select which parameters you would like visualized on the right-side panel. Using Analysis Workbench, this plugin creates the relevant geometries.

Once the plugin is correctly installed in the right folders, simply open STK, create a satellite, right-click it and browse to Satellite Plugins - Astrodyn-UI-Plugin.

## [ReentryHeatingPlugin](ReentryHeatingPlugin)

This plugin was created to allow users the ability to supply design parameters for capsule styled reentry vehicles similar to [NASAâ€™s Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule). The Plugin will create stagnation point heating data for the designed capsule as well as deceleration (G-Load) data which can be reported or graphed natively inside of STK.

For more information about the plugin please refer to the [pdf writeup](ReentryHeatingPlugin/Reentry_Heating_Plugin_README.pdf) or [word writeup](ReentryHeatingPlugin/Reentry_Heating_Plugin_README.doc)
