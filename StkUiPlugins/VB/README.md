## [ReentryHeatingPlugin](ReentryHeatingPlugin)

This plugin was created to allow users the ability to supply design parameters for capsule styled reentry vehicles similar to [NASA’s Apollo program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule). The Plugin will create stagnation point heating data for the designed capsule as well as deceleration (G-Load) data which can be reported or graphed natively inside of STK.
