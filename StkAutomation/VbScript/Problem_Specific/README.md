# VbScript Problem Specific Samples

## [ASCOM Telescope Utility_STK11](ASCOM%20Telescope%20Utility_STK11)

This utility is used as an example for integration between STK and third party applications such as the AStronomy Common Object Model (ASCOM).  This utility will allow users to take advantage of STK’s system modeling capability by creating satellites, or other celestial orbiting bodies, and determine pointing geometry to specified geographic locations on the ground by using STK’s ability to model ‘Facility’ locations and advanced propagation algorithms to create orbiting bodies.

**Note**: For more information about using this utility refer to the full [documentation](ASCOM%20Telescope%20Utility_STK11/ASCOM%20Telescope%20Utility%20README.docx)

**Note**: This is a VB.NET project and not VbScript
