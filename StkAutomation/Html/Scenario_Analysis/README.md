## [VolumetricSatisfactionIntervalUtility.htm](VolumetricSatisfactionIntervalUtility.htm)

This is a utility to create interval list AWB component containing intervals for when any part of a Volumetric is satisfied by a spatial conditions used in a constrained spatial grid. This utility takes the name of the volumetric object to be used, a name for the AWB interval component and a time step that determines the absolute accuracy of the intervals. The interval list component will be nested under the scenario object in AWB.
