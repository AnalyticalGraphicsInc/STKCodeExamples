# Python Scenario Analysis Samples

## Aviator_ObjectModel_CarrierLanding.py

Creates a scenario that demonstrates an aircraft carrier landing using two Aviator aircraft with custom procedures. All inputs are available for editing, though this is better used as a reference for planning Aviator missions programmatically.

### Dependencies

* Licenses: Free, Integration, Aviator

## STK_OM_Tutorial

STK Object Model Walkthrough using Python with comtypes. In the incomplete version, the user is meant to write lines where "Action" is requested in a comment. The comtypes interface is no longer the recommended way of interacting with STK via python (see the [Python API](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#python/pythonGettingStarted.htm?Highlight=python%20api) available in STK 12.1+), but this tutorial is helpful for understanding how the STK object model works. More tutorial content for the STK object model is available in the [Level 2 Integration Certification](https://register.agi.com/training/certification/?cert=integration).

* Licenses: Free, Integration, Analysis Workbench

## ConstellationWizard
Python code and a user inteface to allow subsets of large satellite constellations to quickly be built and loaded into STK, perform analysis, and then unloaded. In this way analysis at different times or with different constellations can be performed without loading in thousands of satellites. The readme within the project folder contains specific requirements for using the tool, as well as explanations for each of the notebooks and how the tool generally works.

## Astrogator Object Model
These notebooks walk you through an introduction to [STK Astrogator](https://help.agi.com/stk/index.htm#astrogator.htm) object model. The tutorial builds a LEO to GEO transfer using a combined inclination and apogee raise maneuver at GEO. The walkthrough demonstrates using a target sequence for a Hohmann Transfer. The comtypes interface is no longer the recommended way of interacting with STK via python (see the [Python API](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#python/pythonGettingStarted.htm?Highlight=python%20api) available in STK 12.1+), but this tutorial is helpful for understanding how the STK Astrogator object model works. More tutorial content for the STK object model is available in the [Level 2 Integration Certification](https://register.agi.com/training/certification/?cert=integration).
