# ExternalWindModel

This code example shows how to integrate external wind models for use with STK. The model used in this example is HWM93 (https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/atmos/hwm.html).

Step 1. Install the HWM93 model from https://pypi.org/project/hwm93/ or https://github.com/space-physics/hwm93  
Step 2. Explore the sample code in HWM93STKpy notebook.
