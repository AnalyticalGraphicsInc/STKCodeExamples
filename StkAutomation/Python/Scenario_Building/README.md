# Python Scenario Building Samples

## [Aviator_ObjectModel_CarrierLanding.py](Aviator_ObjectModel_CarrierLanding.py)

Creates a scenario that demonstrates an aircraft carrier landing using two Aviator aircraft with custom procedures. All inputs are available for editing, though this is better used as a reference for planning Aviator missions programmatically.

### Dependencies

* Licenses: Free, Integration, Aviator
* Other Scripts: N/A
* Scenario: N/A

## [STK_OM_Tutorial](STK_OM_Tutorial)

STK Object Model Walkthrough using Python with comtypes. In the incomplete version, the user is meant to write lines where "Action" is requested in a comment. The comtypes interface is no longer the recommended way of interacting with STK via python (see the [Python API](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#python/pythonGettingStarted.htm?Highlight=python%20api) available in STK 12.1+), but this tutorial is helpful for understanding how the STK object model works. More tutorial content for the STK object model is available in the [Level 2 Integration Certification](https://register.agi.com/training/certification/?cert=integration).

### Dependencies

* Licenses: Free, Integration, Analysis Workbench
* Other Scripts: N/A
* Scenario: N/A

## [AstrogatorObjectModel](AstrogatorObjectModel)

These notebooks walk you through an introduction to [STK Astrogator](https://help.agi.com/stk/index.htm#astrogator.htm) object model. The tutorial builds a LEO to GEO transfer using a combined inclination and apogee raise maneuver at GEO. The walkthrough demonstrates using a target sequence for a Hohmann Transfer. The comtypes interface is no longer the recommended way of interacting with STK via python (see the [Python API](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#python/pythonGettingStarted.htm?Highlight=python%20api) available in STK 12.1+), but this tutorial is helpful for understanding how the STK Astrogator object model works. More tutorial content for the STK object model is available in the [Level 2 Integration Certification](https://register.agi.com/training/certification/?cert=integration).
