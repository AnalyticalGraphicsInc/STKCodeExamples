# Python General Utility Samples

## [stkMetaDataExtractor.py](EditIntervalFile.py)

Allows the user to output an xml or json file that includes each object in the scenario, the description of the scenario, and unique information for each object. The script will also try to output a CZML preview of the scenario. To use the tool, open a command line and navigate to the file location of the script. Run the script in a python environment and enter the filepath of the .sc or .vdf file to be used, as well as the output location of the xml/json and czml. The command line input would look like this:

`python stkMetaDataExtractor.py "C:\Users\username\Documents\STK 12\Scenario1.sc" C:\Users\username\Documents`

## [CombineEphemeris.py](CombineEphemeris.py)

This tool combines multiple STK ephemerides (.e) into one long STK ephemeris. It takes as arguments a directory containing the .e files to join and the name and directory of the new, conjoined ephemeris. The script will create an STK scenario.

## [KmlToStkEphemeris.py](KmlToStkEphemeris.py)

This utility will parse a KML file (.kml) from ForeFlight, FlightAware and possibly other flight log software and output an STK ephemeris file (.e). This file can be loaded into an STK scenario by inserting an aircraft object, changing the propagator to "StkExternal" and specifying the filepath to the ephemeris file.
