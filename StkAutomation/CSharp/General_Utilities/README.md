# C# General Utility Samples

## [SendEphemerisToSTK](SendEphemerisToSTK)

This utility will allow you to add a new option to your Windows right-click > Send To menu for you to send files directly to STK.

This was originally designed to send Satellite Ephemeris files to STK (by the [ComSpOC](https://comspoc.com/) Operators) but has been expanded to include TLE and TCE files.

Recent updates have been added to now include GPX files imported as waypoints on a ground vehicle.  This utility can continue to be extended with additional file types/extensions.

#### Installation

* Move the built executable "SendEphemerisToSTK.exe" to a permanent location of your choice
* Place a shortcut to that executable here: %AppData%/Microsoft/Windows/SendTo
