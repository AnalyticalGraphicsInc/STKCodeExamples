## [FlowerConstellationBuilder](FlowerConstellationBuilder)

This utility will allow you to create many different flower consetllations.  Similar to the walker tool inside STK except flower constellations can be defined using a number of days to repeat, number of petals and 3 phasing parameters.

## [XPlaneUDPToSTK12](XPlaneUDPToSTK12)

This utility connects to X-Plane and reads the position (latitude, longitude, altitude) and attitude (yaw, pitch, roll) data through a UDP connection, then sends it to an aircraft in STK using the Real Time propagator.
