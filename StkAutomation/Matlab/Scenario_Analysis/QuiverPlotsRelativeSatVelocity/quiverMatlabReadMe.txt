Quiver plots in Matlab are a great way of visualizing vector fields. In this example, STK integration is used to bring data in from STK to Matlab. The data is then used to create a quiver plot showing the relative velocity of points on the ground that are covered by a satellite's sensor. 
This script is made for a scenario with the format specified in QuiverExample.vdf. More information on quiver plots can be found here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/quiver.html
