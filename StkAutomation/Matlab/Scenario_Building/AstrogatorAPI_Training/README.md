# Astrogator Object Model API Training Document

These scripts are from a training that walked through using MATLAB to create an [STK Astrogator](https://help.agi.com/stk/index.htm#astrogator.htm) MCS from scratch. The satellite completes a Hohmann transfer from LEO to GEO and also preforms an inclination change. In the version that is not complete, users are required to fill in lines that have headers stating "ACTION REQUIRED". The completed version contains the full script and can be run without any changes.
