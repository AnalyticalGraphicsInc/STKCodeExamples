# SSA Clutter Interference Visualizer

## [SSA_Clutter_Interference_Visualizer.m](SSA_Clutter_Interference_Visualizer.m)

This is meant to be a simple and fast simulator for showing a target object, a randomly generated star like background, and a series of clutter objects traveling along in a constellation group.

The visualizations are controlled with the two dropdowns, one on the left showing the true marker positions of objects (green circle for the target object, red dots for clutter objects, and blue asterisks for stars) and one on the right to show what is included in the simulation. Hitting Update reflects the current settings in the display and an image can be saved with Save Image.

The Clutter Parameters are included to define the properties of the clutter satellites moving along in the direction and spacing specified in image space pixel units. You can provide the number of objects and their relative brightness rate in counts per second. You can also specify how much variability there is with the distribution of the clutter objects, where they start, and how fast they're moving.

For the target it defaults to the center moving along the positive-X direction. You can also change the relative brightness rate and a speed.

Finally for the  general Image and Background Properties you set the image size, noise, integration time, blur, and a density and max brightness parameter for the stars.

This tool was meant to be a way to visualize many of the parameters involved in imaging space based objects in the presence of clutter.
