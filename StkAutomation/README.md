## STK Automation Scripts and Utilities

A collection of scripts and tools that enable you to automate repetitive tasks from outside Systems Tool Kit (STK), integrate other applications with STK, and access STKâ€™s capabilities from other applications.

Each language folder contains the following categories:

- **General_Utilities**: Functions that are used by other, larger projects or are helper scripts for repetitive tasks
- **Problem_Specific**: Larger solutions for a specific problem that STK may or may not solve inherently
- **Scenario_Analysis**: By using a premade scenario or by building a new scenario, perform trades, analyze scenario results and obtain specific metrics for use in a programming environment
- **Scenario_Building**: Create scenarios that demonstrate how to integrate with STK by building an example scenario

These scripts use a combination of the STK Object Model and STK Connect.  New to STK Object Model?
