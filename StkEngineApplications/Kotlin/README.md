## [StkEngine_NoGraphic_Stk12](StkEngine_NoGraphic_Stk12)

A short STK Engine 'No Graphics' example using the Kotlin programming language. Since Kotlin is designed for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), STK Engine libraries made for Java are able to be utilized in Kotlin, providing more flexibility for users looking to use Kotlin for an STK Engine instance over another language. [StkEngine.kt](StkEngine_NoGraphics_Stk12/src/stkengine/StkEngine.kt) contains STK Engine-specific functions, while the other files in this package are normal Kotlin accompaniments. The program creates simple aircraft and facility objects then computes Access between them. The resulting access data is printed to the command line.
