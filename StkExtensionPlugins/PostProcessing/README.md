# Post Processing Scripts

 Using post-processing scripts is a powerful way to take advantage of automating simple file manipulation. A post-processing script can be assigned to any report in STK (reports only, not available for graphs). The script is then triggered after the report is created in a 'temp' location, but before it is displayed/printed/saved/exported. Generally, the script is used to reformat this temp file. The post-processing script is called from a ‘system’ command that passes an argument, which is the path to the 'temp' file containing the original generated report, to the post-processing script. Any scripting or programming language can be used so long as is can be called directly form a system command (this is generally set as a file association), and accepts/reads the temp path as a command line argument. Upon script completion, the 'temp' file is then used to complete the selected operation (post-processing destination).
