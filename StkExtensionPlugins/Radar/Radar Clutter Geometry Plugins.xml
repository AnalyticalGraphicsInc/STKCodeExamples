      <!-- NOTE: The xml reader is case sensitive, so while the keyword ProgID is valid, 
      ProgId is invalid because of the 'd' not being capitalized. 
      Any improper keyword casing violation will cause the plugin to 
      not be registered.

      The following Plugin tags register each Plugin component as an Radar Clutter Geometry Plugin. 

      To enable one of the sample plugins in STK, simply build the component (if necessary), 
      register it in the Windows Registry, and move the registration line below 
      outside of this comment block.

      <Plugin DisplayName = "Clutter Geometry CPP Example" ProgID = "Agi.Radar.ClutterGeometry.CPP.Example1"/>
      <Plugin DisplayName = "Clutter Geometry CSharp Example" ProgID = "Agi.Radar.ClutterGeometry.CSharp.Example1"/>
      <Plugin DisplayName = "Clutter Geometry WSC Example" ProgID = "Agi.Radar.ClutterGeometry.WSC.Example"/>
